## 📂 Featured Projects
### Road Safety Analysis Using Machine Learning 
The Road Safety Analysis project for Indian highways, diverse
machine learning models like linear regression, KNN, random forest, SVM, etc., were employed. These models
analyzed various factors to determine the safest highways in India. Through predictive analytics, they assessed
variables such as traffic volume, road conditions, accident history, and weather patterns to identify highways with
the lowest risk of accidents, aiding in strategic road planning and safety enhancement measures.

### Movie Recommendation System - https://github.com/rohanbalixz/Movie-Recommendation-System
Harnessing data from 5000 movies on TMDB, I implemented a Bag of Words
model for natural language processing. Utilizing vectorization techniques like TF-IDF, the system generates five
tailored movie recommendations based on your selection. This method enhances accuracy and personalization.

### Car Price Prediction System - https://github.com/rohanbalixz/Car-Price-Prediction-System
The Car Resell Price Prediction System utilizes a Linear Regression machine learning model to estimate the resale value of used cars. By analyzing various car attributes and historical sales data, this system provides accurate price predictions, helping users make informed decisions about buying or selling their vehicles.
